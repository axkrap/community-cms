INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
--------20/04/08---------

Requirements:
PHP
MySQL
(Haven't tested for version compatability yet)


Instructions:
Edit the well documented config.php to your needs and upload the comcms directory to your webserver.
Using a tool such as phpMyAdmin, import the MySQL database from the communitycms.sql file.

While this install process is quite labourous, there are plans in the future for an automated installer.
