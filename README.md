Community CMS
=============

Community CMS is a PHP-based content management system. This system was designed to enable easy management of informational content by various community organizations. Community CMS uses a MySQL database as a storage backend.

The Community CMS project started many years ago, and I have learned a lot since it started. I am aware that the code quality is relatively poor, and that several features may be unfinished or glitchy. As I continue to improve parts of the project, I will continue to try to bring the components up to some reasonable standard of code quality, both for my own experience, and to ease maintenance down the road.

Installation
------------

There is no supported installation method at this time. There is a web-based installer, but it has not been tested in over a year. Attempt to install the software at your own risk.

Support
-------

If you can get the system up and running, feel free to use GitHub's issue tracker to file bug reports or submit pull requests. I will monitor these channels, although I cannot promise that all issues will be resolved.

If you find a security vulnerability, please do not report it through public channels, rather contact me (Stephen) directly.
